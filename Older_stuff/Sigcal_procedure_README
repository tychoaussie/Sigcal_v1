20150224 - Sigcal version 2

How to calibrate with the SIGCAL software package:

1) Determine the voltage sensitivity of each channel on the digitizer in microvolts per count.
2) Record the sensitivity of the laser position system in millivolts per micron.
3) Determine the ratio between the fulcrum of the seismometer to the center of mass, from
the fulcrum to the laser measurement point. THis is known as the laser cal constant.
 - For the SM3, this ratio is about 0.579, because the laser measurement point is farther away
   from the fulcrum than the center of mass.
 - For the SKM, this ratio is about 0.648 for the same reason. 
 - For the S1-P, this ratio is 1.0, because the laser measurement point is at the center of mass.
 - For the Vegik, this ratio is 1.0, because the laser measurement point is at the center of mass.
4) Determine the free-period of the sensor by disconnecting the damping resistor and exciting the
   mass. 
    - Analyze the free period by using the script: python freeperiod.py
5) Re-install the damping resistor and test the damping ratio by exciting the mass. 
   Apply four to five impulses while connected to the digitizer.
     - Analyze the damping ratio by using the script: python dampingratio.py
6) Create the calibration control file by using the script: python calcontrol.py
     - This script will prompt you for the following information:
     - Station Name:
     - Four channels, Channels 0 through 3
       - Channel name
       - Channel sensitivity in terms of microvolts per count. 
     - Laser sensitivity in terms of millivolts per micron. 
     - Laser geometric calibration constant. (This is a ratio and is unitless.)
     - Free period of the sensor in Hz.
     - Damping ratio of the sensor.
     - THe channel number (0 through 3) representing the sensor being calibrated
       - This should correlate as one of the four channels listed above.
     - The channel number (0 through 3) of representing the laser position sensor.
7) After creation of the calibration control file, place a copy within a new directory
   to be used with the digitized files of the sine sweep data to be used in the calibration.

8) Now that :
    - the sensitivity of the digizer is known
    - the sensitivity of the laser is known
    - the geometric difference between the laser measurement point and the center of mass is known
    - the free period is known
    - the damping ratio is known
    - the channel number for the sensor under test and the laser position sensor is specified
   We will be able to determine exactly:
    - the millivolt output of the sensor coil that represents an unknown velocity
    - the millivolt output of the laser that represents a known mass displacment.
   From mass motion, we will be able to calculate ground motion using free period and damping ratio.
   From ground motion, we will be able to calculate sensor velocity at each tested frequency.
   By dividing the sensor voltage output by the calculated sensor velocity, we can determine
     the sensor sensitivity at the tested frequency.
   By performing this operation at each frequency within the sensor passband, we can construct
     the frequency response curve for the sensor, taking into account all variables such as:
       - seismometer
       - preamplifier
       - coil loading due to impedance mismatch or low amplifier input impedance.

9) Begin a sine sweep of the sensor by exciting the calibration coil with a single sine wave at
   a voltage amplitude sufficient to yield good displacement for the laser position sensor. 
   - It is suggested that at frequencies above 3 Hz, that voltage amplitude be doubled to preserve
   - sufficient ground motion for good laser resolution.
   - Dwell at each frequency step for 60 seconds, or 10 periods, whichever is greater.

10) Suggested calibration steps:
    - 0.1 Hz
    - 0.3 Hz
    - 0.5 Hz
    - 0.7 Hz
    - 0.9 Hz
    - 1.0 Hz
    - 1.1 Hz
    - 1.3 Hz
    - 1.5 Hz
    - 2.0 Hz
    - 2.5 Hz - Double your sine wave voltage amplitude
    - 5.0 Hz
    - 7.5 Hz - Double it again (4x original voltage amplitude). 
    - 10.0 Hz
    Because the calibration compares sensor coil voltage output to mass displacement, it is independent
    of the calibration coil voltage and is unaffected by drive voltage changes. The calibration is affected,
    however, by insufficient ground motion for good laser resolution. In general, ground motion should never
    be allowed to fall below +- 1 mm, if possible.

11) Convert the data to a standard format.
    - Sigcal version 2, at present, works with EITHER :
       - the Symmetric research .csv format
       -  OR with data stored in .sac format. 
    - Convert your digitizer data to one of these formats, making sure that the channel names
      in the data match the channel names located in the calibration control file for both the
      sensor and the laser position sensor.
    - csv2sac.py is one such converter. It converts Symmetric Research USBXCH .dat files into both
      a csv format as well as a whole series of SAC files. Other converters will convert from CSS3.0
      into SAC. Additional converters exist. Whatever converter is used, the station name and channel
      name should be embedded within the file name for Sigcal to properly find the data for each channel.

12) Strip out all data files that contained mixed sine waves. 
    - Sigcal requires that each file in the matrix contain only one specific frequency. Sigcal
      will use an FFT to calculate rms energy for both channels, and it is assumed that the data
      is sinusoidal at the one frequency. The rms energy of the sensor is divided by the rms of 
      the laser, along with 2*pi*f, to calculate the V/m/second at that frequency.
13) Once the matrix of files (either SAC or csv) has been cleaned of all extra data, we run sigcal
    to process the curve and generate the sac poles and zeros file.
