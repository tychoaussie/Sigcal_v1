File converters for symmetric research:

dat2asc.exe - Use this program for dat files created using the USB4CH series of digitizers. 
THe latest code from December 2015 creates multiple types of ascii files.
The most common one (that is used by our utilities) is the cs4 format. This is a 
comma separated variable text file with 17 columns. This is the format that is used
by the latest dat2sac conversion utility.

For historical purposes, I have renamed the 2010 code as dat2asc_old.exe but it has
problems in handling the timing for conversion of the dat files. So, use the new
version.

Command example:

dat2asc.exe c:\seismo\mydatafiles\00000001.dat cs4


par42asc.exe - Use this program for dat files created using the PAR4CH seris of digitizers.

par42asc.exe c:\seismo\mydatafiles\00000001.dat /tymd

The two ascii file outputs will be different from one another. I am working on accomodating
by creating an dat-to-sac file converter that can identify the different dat files,
choose the proper converter, and appropriately convert either type of file. For now, only the 
USB4CH model is supported.
