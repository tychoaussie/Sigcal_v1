File converters for symmetric research:

dat2asc.exe - Use this program for dat files created using the USB4CH series of digitizers. 

Command example:

dat2asc.exe c:\seismo\mydatafiles\00000001.dat csv


par42asc.exe - Use this program for dat files created using the PAR4CH seris of digitizers.

par42asc.exe c:\seismo\mydatafiles\00000001.dat /tymd

The two ascii file outputs will be different from one another. I am working on accomodating
by creating an ascii-to-sac file converter that will identify and appropriately convert 
either file.
